# Summary of the DevOps Enterprise Summit 2017

## DevOps: Who Does What? —Cornelia Davis, Pivotal
If you're asking yourself how the operators, middleware people, developers, architects etc should be cooperating, watch this talk.
Cornelia Davis gives us a blueprint for a new organisational structure within an IT department that is suited for the new devops practices and toolsets. She starts from a classic siloed, waterfall organisation where work is thrown over the wall and step by step she moves all roles and responsabilities to 4 new 'houses'.

## The Key to High Performance: What the Data Says —Gene Kim, Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Nigel Kersten
The state of devops report tells us how different companies are performing when it comes to devops practices and what this means for the quality, stability and throughput of their software, with respect to each other.

Some key findings:
* Loosely coupled architectures and teams are the strongest predictor of continuous delivery
* DevOps applies to all kinds of organizations (profit and non-profit, mainframe vs microservices, etc)
* Transformational leaders share five common characteristics that significantly shape an organization's culture and practices, leading to high performance
* High-performing teams continue to achieve both faster throughput and better stability

=> Some of the ideas that Cornelia Davis presents is in here too.

- When switching from on-premise IT to cloud, total spending will go up, because it's hard to decomission on-premise IT.
- If there's an ROI for going to the cloud, then do it.
- Start small, with non-critical applications that will anger now one if things fall down.
- When we are cloud-first, when we can align tooling, processes we have in the dev world, into the ops world, DevOps will truly happen.
- "In the future, I think, there won't be an IT department as such. It will be so merged with the business, that you won't understand what is the IT departement."
- It's about doing more with the same.
- "BizDevOps"1. 
- Mixed teams, platform team, with tribes around roles/technologies.
- A ticket is a unit of work. A ticket is not that far away from a user story.
- Cloud It's not about reducing costs, it's about increasing competitive advantage through DevOps.
    - free up resources to work on high-value tasks
    - cloud providers have the means to build out data-centers around the world with more capabilities
    - What about cloud security?
