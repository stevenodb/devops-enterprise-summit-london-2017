=> Some of the ideas that Cornelia Davis presents is in here too.

- When switching from on-premise IT to cloud, total spending will go up, because it's hard to decomission on-premise IT.
- If there's an ROI for going to the cloud, then do it.
- Start small, with non-critical applications that will anger now one if things fall down.
- When we are cloud-first, when we can align tooling, processes we have in the dev world, into the ops world, DevOps will truly happen.
- "In the future, I think, there won't be an IT department as such. It will be so merged with the business, that you won't understand what is the IT departement."
- It's about doing more with the same.
- "BizDevOps"1. 
- Mixed teams, platform team, with tribes around roles/technologies.
- A ticket is a unit of work. A ticket is not that far away from a user story.
- Cloud It's not about reducing costs, it's about increasing competitive advantage through DevOps.
    - free up resources to work on high-value tasks
    - cloud providers have the means to build out data-centers around the world with more capabilities
